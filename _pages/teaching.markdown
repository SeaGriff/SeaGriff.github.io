## For students

You are always welcome to contact me to set up an individual meeting or directed reading.

My office is in MacMillan Hall, room 113. My Math 520 office hours are tentatively 2-4 pm on Mondays. That means that you are invited to drop by during those hours and ask me whatever you like. Coming in to office hours while confused is an extremely efficient method of learning.

A note on struggling: learning mathematics is itself a learnable skill. Developing this skill is probably more important that any individual course's material (for one thing, you may forget the material and need to relearn it). The only way to do so is to grapple with mathematics you currently find difficult. Not immediately understanding everything in a course is a prequisite to getting the most from it!
